/*!
 * C++20 introduces modules, a modern solution for componentization of C++ libraries and programs.
 * A module is a set of source code files that are compiled independently of the translation units that import them.
 * Modules eliminate or greatly reduce many of the problems associated with the use of header files, and also potentially reduce compilation times.
 * Macros, preprocessor directives, and non-exported names declared in a module are not visible and therefore have no effect on the compilation of the translation unit that imports the module.
 * You can import modules in any order without concern for macro redefinitions. Declarations in the importing translation unit do not participate in overload resolution or name lookup in the imported module.
 * After a module is compiled once, the results are stored in a binary file that describes all the exported types, functions and templates. That file can be processed much faster than a header file, and can be reused by the compiler every place where the module is imported in a project.
